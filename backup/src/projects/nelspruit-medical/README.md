# Nelspruit Medical Center - Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This is a mockup website for a fictional medical center in Nelspruit, South Africa. The project demonstrates my ability to create professional healthcare websites with a focus on accessibility, clean design, and user-friendly navigation.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for all device sizes
- Interactive appointment booking system (demonstration only)
- Doctor profiles and service information
- Testimonials section
- Emergency information callout
- Animated elements for enhanced user experience
- Mockup notification to indicate this is a demonstration project

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom animations and transitions)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Inter)

## Design Approach

The design uses a clean, professional aesthetic with a blue color scheme that conveys trust and reliability - essential qualities for a healthcare provider. The layout prioritizes easy access to important information like services, doctor profiles, and appointment booking.

## Note

This is a portfolio demonstration project and not a real medical center website. All interactive elements show messages instead of performing real actions.

## Back to Portfolio

A "Back to Portfolio" button is included to easily navigate back to the main portfolio page.
