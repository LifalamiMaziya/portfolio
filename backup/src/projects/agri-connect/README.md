# AgriConnect - Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This is a mockup website for a fictional agricultural technology platform that connects farmers with resources, markets, and tools. The project showcases my ability to create modern, functional websites for the agricultural sector with a focus on usability and clean design.

## Features

- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
- Interactive elements including product showcases and service information
- User-friendly navigation and information architecture
- Animated elements that enhance the user experience
- Mockup notification to indicate this is a demonstration project

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom animations and transitions)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts

## Design Approach

The design uses earthy tones and natural colors that reflect the agricultural focus of the platform. The layout is structured to provide clear information about the platform's features and benefits while maintaining a modern, tech-forward appearance that communicates innovation in agriculture.

## Note

This is a portfolio demonstration project and not a real agricultural platform. All interactive elements show messages instead of performing real actions.

A "Back to Portfolio" button is included to easily navigate back to the main portfolio page.
